            <p>My job at ECI was my first oportunity to put my newly acquired Software Development skills to the test, landing an Associate Developer position soon after graduating EKU.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Having interviewed for a Java Dev position I was quickly moved onto a C# team to work on an asp.NET application called TAGS. 
                This provided me the oportunity to learn a new languasge as well as working with a large team in the Agile Scrum environment. 
                I saw success quickly after joining the team by spearheading the development of the tagging system utilized by the application.

            <p>
                Because of the success I achived on my first team I was selected to join a newly formed team working on a similar webapplication called
                 3-IN-1 Systems Engineering Application for use by our Air Force customer. 
                 This project was just starting and had just finished the contract negotioan phase. This project would utilize the Waterfall Software development approach and so we began the design phase.
                 While working on wireframes for several key UIs and developing database schema again I had an opportunity to step up into the scrum master role for the team. 
                 I was then the team's primary liasion with the AF PO. Utilizing skills learned in my Software Engineering courses at EKU I worked on almost all of the UML diagrams and neccesary contract artifacts\/deliverables.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                As the project moved into the development phase I also became a supervisor making my project roles that of Developer\/Scrum Master\/and Dev Supervisor. It was also at this time that the team grew from 3 developers to its largest of 14 at one time.
